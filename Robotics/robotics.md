<h1>Robotics</h1>
Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions.<br>
<h2>5 main things to know</h2>
Operator Interface <br>
Robot is used with some human controllers. The operator interface - commonly referred as a Human Robot Interface - is the medium that allows the user and the robot to communicate. <br>
HRI (Human Robot Interface) should be: intuitive to use, enable operators to communicate effectively with the robot. <br>
<br>
Mobility<br>
In order for a robot to complete a task, it needs to be able to move in its environment. In robotics, this movement is called locomotion. Mobility in robotics is achieved in many different ways. For example, some robots mimic human movement, like those used on assembly lines or those whose design is based on human anatomy. Flying robots and drones make use of propellers and other propulsion systems. Other robots, such as the rovers deployed on Mars and other celestial bodies, require wheels to get around. <br>
<br>
Manipulators & effectors
For any robot to be worthwhile, it must be able to interact with its environment; that’s where manipulators and effectors come into play. These are the parts of the robot that allow it to pick up objects and move them, or manipulate items that are separate from the system. Human-like robots will employ appendages and digits that work like human hands, in order to complete a given task. <br>
<br>
Programming
Programming is essentially the language an operator uses to communicate with the robot. Traditionally, any action that a robot was required to perform had to be programmed. These days, advanced programming allows robotic systems to learn and adapt to changes within its environment, which is truly a remarkable feat of engineering. 
<br>
Generally speaking, commands can be provided by the user in real time for the robot to perform, or the robot can be programmed to perform a series of tasks, in sequence, autonomously.<br>
<br>
Sensing & Perception<br>
Robots use sensors to gather information. This information lets the robot know the physical space it occupies, where it needs to go, and if any obstacles block its path. Sensors also collect information to help the robot decide how to react to objects it encounters. The right sensor must be selected for each robot’s specific application to ensure that the correct decisions are made. <br>
